    intro: `      Pepper & Poppy was created in August of 2021 after over 15 years in a “traditional” salon setting. It was time to break out of my mold and go solo to pursue my love for hair without distraction by the noise of my old surroundings.`, 
    about: [`      I come from a technical and precision background in cutting, yet I am always able to integrate texture and shapes in a free-form way to customize any look. I continue to seek out individual education to always add to my craft, but my true love will always be precision cutting. I love structure!!!!`, 
    
    `       In haircolor, my focus is usually more natural looking colors, with lived-in looks that grow out gracefully. I do not do vivid color services (think “rainbow” colors) so if this is something you are looking for, I can happily recommend a fellow stylist-pal who specializes in these types of services.`],
